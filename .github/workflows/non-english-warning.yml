              This pull request contains changes to non-English content, which must be handled through the Crowdin platform instead of GitHub.
              We value your suggestion and request that you check out [how to help us translate](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/translation-program/#help-us-translate), and suggest these updates directly in [our Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org) where they can be properly reviewed.
              Please post here or join [our Discord](https://ethereum.org/discord) if you have questions!`
