# How to: Swap tokens

A token swap involved the exchange of two different assets that exist on the Ethereum network, for example swapping ETH for DAI (an ERC-20 token). You can swap most of the tokens using decentralized exchanges. You will need to have a crypto wallet to swap tokens. If you do not have one already, you can follow this tutorial: How to "register" an Ethereum account.

## 1. Connect your wallet to the decentralized exchange (DEX) of your choice.

Some popular exchanges are:

- [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
- [1Inch](https://app.1inch.io/#/1/unified/swap/ETH/DAI)
- [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/swap)

## 2. Select the pair of tokens you wish to swap. 
For example, ETH and DAI. Make sure you have funds in one of the two tokens.

## 3. Enter the amount of tokens you want to trade. 

Also review the details of the transaction. Check the exchange rate and any other fees to prevent ugly surprises.

## 4. Confirm the transaction.

The exchange will automatically calculate how many tokens you will get.

## 5. Wait for the transaction to be processed.
You can view the progress of the transaction on any blockchain explorer. This process should not take longer than 10 minutes. 

You will automatically receive the swapped tokens in your wallet once the transaction is processed.
