# How to: Bridge tokens to layer 2

Layer 2s are scaling solutions for Ethereum which allow users to transact with increased speed and decreased costs. Many popular crypto projects are moving to layer 2s because of these benefits. The simplest way to move tokens from Ethereum to layer 2 is to use a bridge project.

If you have your funds in a wallet, follow these steps:

## 1. Determine which layer 2 network you want to use

You can learn more about the different projects and important links on our [layer 2 page](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/).

## 2. Go to the selected bridge

Some popular layer 2s are:
- [Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)
- [Optimism bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit)
- [Boba network bridge](https://gateway.boba.network/)

## 3. Connect to the bridge with your wallet

Make sure you are connected to the Ethereum Mainnet network. 

## 4. Specify the amount and move the funds

Review the amount that you will get in return on the layer 2 network and the fees to avoid unpleasant surprises.

## 5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

You will have to pay a fee in form of ETH for processing the transaction.

## 6. Wait for your funds to be moved

This process should not take more than a 10-20 minutes.

## 7. Add the selected layer 2 network to your wallet

You can use [chainlist.org](http://chainlist.org) to find the network details. Once the network is added and transaction finished, you should see the tokens in your wallet.

**What if I have funds on an exchange?**

You might be able to withdraw to some layer 2s directly from an exchange. Check out “Move to layer 2” section of our [Layer 2 page](/layer-2/) for more information.
