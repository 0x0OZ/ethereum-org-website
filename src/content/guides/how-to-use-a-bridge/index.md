# How to: Bridge tokens to layer 2

Layer 2s are scaling solutions for Ethereum which allow users to transact with increased speed and decreased costs. Many popular crypto projects are moving to layer 2s because of these benefits. The simplest way to move tokens to layer 2 is to use a bridge project.

If you have your funds on an exchange, you might be able to withdraw to some layer 2s directly. Check out “Move to layer 2” section of our  [Layer 2 page](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/) for more information.

If you have your funds in a wallet, follow these steps:

1. **Determine which layer 2 network you want to use.** You can learn more about different projects on our [layer 2 page](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/).
2. **Go to the selected bridge:**
    1. [Arbitrum bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=42161)
    2. [Optimism bridge](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit)
    3. [Boba network bridge](https://gateway.boba.network/)
3. **Connect to the bridge** with your wallet. Make sure you are connected to the Ethereum mainnet network. 
4. **Specify the amount and move the funds** by clicking on the button.
5. **Confirm the transaction in your wallet** and pay the ETH fee.
6. **Wait for your funds to be moved** onto the selected layer 2 network. This process should not take more than a few minutes.
7. **Add the selected layer 2 network to your wallet** if needed. You can use [chainlist.org](http://chainlist.org) to find the network details.
