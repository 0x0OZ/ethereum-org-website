# How to: Use a wallet

Learn how to operate all the basic functions of a wallet. If you don’t have one yet, check out our How to: "Register" an Ethereum account.


## Open your wallet

You should see a dashboard that will likely show your balance and contain buttons to Send and Receive tokens. 

## Receive cryptocurrency

Each wallet has its own receiving Ethereum address which is a unique sequence of numbers and letters. The address functions like a bank account number. Ethereum address will always start with “0x”.

You need to provide the sender with your receiving address. Many wallet apps will let you copy to clipboard the address or show a QR code to scan for an easier usage. 

## Send cryptocurrency

Would you like to send ETH to another wallet? 

1. You need the receiving address and network of the recipient.
2. Most wallets will have a “Send” button on dashboards that you need to click on.  
3. Enter the receiving address or scan a QR code with your camera so that you don’t have to write the address manually.

4. Many assets, like DAI or USDC, exist on multiple networks. When transferring crypto tokens, make sure that the other side is using the same network as you are. 
5. Every transaction will require the sender to pay small fee, the exact amount changes depending on network congestion. 
6. Once your transaction is processed, the crypto will show up in the recipient’s account. This might take anywhere from few seconds to few minutes.

## Connecting to projects

Your address represents you on all Ethereum projects. You will not need to register individually on any project. Once you have a wallet, you can connect to any Ethereum project without any additional information. No emails or any other personal information are needed.

1. Visit any project’s website.
2. Most of them will have a button in the menu to “Open the App”. 
3. Once you are in the app simply click on “Connect”

4. Select your wallet from the offered list. If you cant see your wallet, maybe it will be hidden under “WalletConnect” option.

5. You will have to confirm a signature request in your wallet to confirm the connection. It should not cost anything.
6. Thats it! Start using the app. You can find some interesting projects on our [dApps page](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/#explore).

### FAQ

**If I own an ETH address, do I own the same address on other blockchains?**

- You can use the same address on many popular blockchains (if you have the type of wallet with a recovery phrase). This [list](https://chainlist.org/) will show you which blockchains you can use with the same address. Some blockchains like Bitcoin are completely separate and you will need a different address with a different format. If you have a smart contract wallet you should check its product website for more info on what blockchains are allowed.

**Can I use the same address on multiple devices?**

- Yes you can use the same address on multiple devices. Wallets are technically only an interface to show you your balance and to make transactions, your wallets are not store inside the wallet, but on the blockchain.

**I have not received the crypto, where can I check the status of a transaction?**

- You can use [block explorers](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-and-analytics/block-explorers/) to see the status of any transaction real time.

**Can I cancel or return transactions?**

- No, once transaction is initiated it cannot be canceled.
