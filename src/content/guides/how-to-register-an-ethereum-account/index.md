# Guide: How to register an Ethereum account

Creating Ethereum account is very easy and anyone can do it for free with a specific type of app commonly referred to as a wallet. With a wallet you can then hold, send and receive crypto and connect to crypto projects that will enable you to trade NFTs, exchange coins, access play-to-earn games, Defi and much more. 

## Step 1: Visit our curated list of wallets

We have prepared a list of trusted wallets that you should not be afraid to use. A wallet is like an online bank account for Ethereum. There are dozens of different wallets to choose from: mobile, desktop or even browser extensions.

## Step 2: Select a wallet that suits your needs

If you are new, you should choose a filter “New to crypto” to only view those wallets that include all necessary features we think would be particularly good for beginners. There are also other profile filters as well if your needs are different.

## Step 3: Download & Install a wallet

Once you have decided on a specific wallet, download and install it. Most wallet products will automatically generate an Ethereum account so you don't need one before you download a wallet. 

## Step 4: Open the wallet app & store your recovery phrase

Now you have your Ethereum account. Some apps will request you to save a recovery phrase when you first open the application (optional). 

This is extremely important as the person who knows this secret phrase can take control of your account. Never share this with anyone. This phrase should contain 12 randomly generated words. The order of the words matter!

Once you have saved your recovery phrase you should see your wallet dashboard with your balance. Check out our Guide: [How to use a wallet.](https://ethereum.org/en/guides/how-to-use-a-wallet)


### FAQ

**Can I send Bitcoin to an Ethereum address and vice versa?**

- No you cannot, you need two different addresses for that as bitcoin is not ethereum based blockchain.

**Is having my own wallet safer than keeping my funds on an exchange?**

- Yes, nobody else will have access to your funds, not even the wallet creators can access your funds if you have a wallet with own recovery phrase. Only the person that possesses the recovery phrase can control the funds.
