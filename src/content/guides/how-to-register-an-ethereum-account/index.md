# How to: "Register" an Ethereum account

Creating an Ethereum account is very easy, and anyone can do it for free with a specific type of app commonly known as a wallet. Wallets let you hold, send, and receive crypto. You can also connect to projects on Ethereum that will let you trade NFTs, exchange coins, access play-to-earn games, unlock Defi and much more.

## Step 1: Browse our curated list of wallets

A wallet is like an online bank account for Ethereum. There are dozens of different wallets to choose from—mobile, desktop, or even browser extensions. Our curated list of trusted wallets is a good place to start.

## Step 2: Choose a wallet that suits your needs

If you are new, you can activate the “New to crypto” filter to view only those wallets that include all necessary features we think would be particularly suitable for beginners. There are also other profile filters to cater to your needs.

## Step 3: Download and install your wallet app

Once you have decided on a specific wallet, visit their website, download and install it. All of them should be free. 

## Step 4: Open the app and generate or import your Ethereum account
The first time you open your new wallet you might be asked to choose between creating a new account or importing an existing one. Click on the new account creation. 


## Step 5: Store your recovery phrase

Some apps will request you to save a recovery phrase. This is extremely important as the person who knows this secret phrase can take control of your account. Never share this with anyone. This phrase should contain 12 randomly generated words (the order of the words matter).

Once you have saved your recovery phrase you should see your wallet dashboard with your balance. Check out our Guide: [How to use a wallet.](https://ethereum.org/en/guides/how-to-use-a-wallet)


### Frequently asked questions

**Are my wallet and my Ethereum account the same?**
- No, wallets have the ability to create a new Ethereum account, but the account lives on Ethereum and wallets connect to it. So if you lose your wallet you can still recover your account with the recovery phrase.

**Can I send Bitcoin to an Ethereum address and vice versa?**

- No you cannot, you need two different accounts.

**Is having my own wallet safer than keeping my funds on an exchange?**

- Yes, this is a much safer option because nobody else will have access to your funds. There are unfortunately many examples of failed exchanges that filed for bankrupcy and lost users' savings. Hacks, frozen accounts or blocked withdrawals are some other common risks. Owning a wallet (with a recovery phrase) is the best way to safeguard your assets. 

**If I own an ETH address, do I own the same address on other blockchains?**

- You can use the same address on many popular blockchains (if you have the type of wallet with a recovery phrase). This [list](https://chainlist.org/) will show you which blockchains you can use with the same address. Some blockchains like Bitcoin are completely separate and you will need a different address with a different format. If you have a smart contract wallet you should check its product website for more info on what blockchains are allowed.
