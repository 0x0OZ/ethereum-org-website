title: The Ethereum roadmap
description: High level overview of how Ethereum will change in the future
---

Ethereum is a powerful platform for global coordination, but it is not finished! An ambitious set of improvements will upgrade Ethereum from its current form into a fully scaled, resilient platform that will persist for centuries, no matter what the future may hold. These upgrades are laid out in the Ethereum roadmap.

The Ethereum roadmap is a set of upgrades that the Ethereum community expects to incorporate into the Ethereum protocol in the future. It acts like a blueprint that developers can follow to evolve from its current state to its final form, years from now. The roadmap is forward-looking - the start of the roadmap is always the present day. When upgrades are implemented, they drop off the roadmap and become part of Ethereum's history.

## What changes are coming to Ethereum?

### More security

Ethereum is the most secure and decentralized smart-contract platform in existence. However, there are still improvements that can be made so that Ethereum stays resilient to any level of attack far into the future. These include subtle changes to the way Ethereum clients deal with competing blocks, as well as increasing the speed the network considers blocks to be "finalized" (meaning they can't be changed without extreme economic losses to an attacker). There are also improvements that make censoring transactions much more difficult by making block proposers blind to the actual contents of their blocks, and new ways to identify when a client is censoring. Together these improvements will upgrade the proof-of-stake protocol so that users - from individuals to corporations - can have near-instant transaction confirmation and enjoy complete confidence in the reliability of their apps, data and assets on Ethereum.

### Faster, cheaper transactions

Rollups are the foundations of Ethereum scaling. There is already a vibrant ecosystem of rollups that are providing fast, cheap transactions. However, they are still in their "training wheels" phase where critical components are run by centralized operators. Decentralizing the rollup infrastructure is a critical part of scaling Ethereum without compromising on Ethereum's core ethos of decentralization. At the same time, Ethereum itself does not yet provide a rollup-friendly way to handle data- it is too expensive for rollups to post theur data to Ethereum and this limits how cheaply users can transact. New data handling methods including adding data-blobs to blocks and sharding data across nodes will solve this problem, leading to near-instant, <$0.001 transactions for users.

### Breaking down barriers

Today, getting all the benefits of Ethereum (decentralized, permissionless, censorship resistant) requires running a node, which itself requires some technical know-how and non-trivial hardware. Users that do not run nodes are still required to know how to manage wallets, accounts and keys. Users have to choose between the relatively poor user-experience associated with self-custody, or the frictionless but centralized and permissioned experience offered by centralized intermediaries. In the future, these barriers will be torn down by extremely lightweight ndoes that can be embedded invisibly inside wallets and apps, or run usign negligible resources on computers. New ways to interact with accounts will make interacting with Ethereum as straightforward as using any of today's familiar apps.

### Future-proofing

Today's Ethereum researchers and developers are building a protocol for future generations. This means anticipating problems that could arise in decades to centuries and solving them now. One such future problem is the development of quantum computers that can undermine Ethereum's present-day cryptography. There are researchers solving this problem today by prototyping new cryptography that will stay secure even against quantum-enabled attackers. Ethereum has also accumulated some technical debt - inefficiencies hanging over from previous upgrades - that can be cleaned up to better position Ethereum to succeed over the long term. This includes some technical upgrades to the Ethereum Virtual Machine as well as other parts of the protocol.

## Roadmap FAQs

### Why does Ethereum need a roadmap?

Ethereum is a network that undergoes periodic upgrades that enhance its scalability, security or sustainability. One of the core strengths of Ethereum is that it is not fixed forever in its current form - as new ideas arise from research and development they can be implemented to make sure Ethereum is ever-improving. This gives Ethereum the flexibility to tackle emerging challenges and keep up with the most advanced technological breakthroughs in cryptography, computing and cryptoeconomics.

One way to think about Ethereum development is by analogy to biological evolution. A network that is able to adapt to new challenges and maintain fitness is more likely to succeed that one that is resistant to change. We aim for homeostasis rather than ossification, although as the network evolves to become more and more performant, scalable and secure over time fewer and fewer changes to the protocol will be required.

### Is the roadmap set in stone?

No! The roadmap is the current plan for upgrading Ethereum in the near term and also far into the future. The roadmap can change as new information and new technology becomes available. For example, the original Ethereum roadmap intended for sharding to be implemented before The Merge. However, scaling by rollups developed much faster than expected and the roadmap was updated to focus on layer-2 scaling first, allowing The Merge to happen sooner than originally anticipated. The roadmap is a set of intentions for improving Ethereum - it is the research and developer community's best guess about where we should go from here.

### Who decides the roadmap?

The roadmap is mostly the result of years of work by researchers and developers - because the protocol is very technical - but any motivated person can participate. Ideas usually start off as discussions on a forum such as [ethresear.ch](ethresear.ch), [Ethereum magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) or the Eth R&D discord server. They may be responses to new vulnerabilities that are discovered, suggestions from organizations working in the application layer (such as dapps and exchanges) or from known frictions for end users (such as costs or transaction speeds). When these ideas mature, they can be proposed as Ethereum Improvement Protocols. EIPS undergo intense investigation and simulation before being scheduled for client teams to implement. Then, they are prototyped and tested extensively before eventually being scheduled for release. This is all done in public so that anyone from the community can weigh in at any time.
