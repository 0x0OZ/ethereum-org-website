                  Every transaction on Ethereum requires a small form of payment
                  to processâ€”these fees are known as â€˜gasâ€™ fee. Just like you
                  need to pay for postage to send a letter, Ethereum requires
                  you to pay gas fee to send a transaction.

                Think of Ethereum as a large computer network where people can
                do tasks like sending messages or running programs. Just like in
                the real world, these tasks require energy to get done.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                In Ethereum, each computational action has a set "gas" price.
                Your gas fees are the total cost of the actions in your
                transaction. When you send a transaction or run a smart
                contract, you pay in gas fees to process it.

              <Text>
                Whenever the amount of computation (gas) being done on Ethereum
                exceeds its target level, gas fees will begin to increase. The
                more it goes over the target level, the quicker gas fees
                increase.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                Higher fees could be caused by things like popular dapps or
                NFTs, periodically increased trading on DEXs, or an overwhelming
                number of user activity at peak times.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                Developers on Ethereum should take care to optimise their smart
                contracts usage before deploying. If lots of people are using a
                poorly written smart contract, it will consume more gas and
                could inadvertently cause network congestion.

                In November 2017, the popular CryptoKitties project was
                launched. Its rapid spike in popularity caused significant
                network congestion and extremely high gas fees. The challenges
                posed by CryptoKitties accelerated the urgency of finding
                solutions for scaling Ethereum.

                  computation? More complex actions, like interacting with a

                The formula for calculating a gas fee is units of gas used *
                (base fee + priority fee). Most wallets will calculate gas usage
                and display it in a more straight-forward way.
