                <Text>
                  Think of Ethereum as a large computer network where people can
                  do tasks like sending messages or running programs. Just like
                  in the real world, these tasks require energy to get done.
                </Text>
                <Text>
                  In Ethereum, each computational action has a set "gas" price.
                  Your gas fees are the total cost of the actions in your
                  transaction. When you send a transaction or run a smart
                  contract, you pay in gas fees to process it.

                  While higher fees on Ethereum are sometimes inevitable, there
                  are strategies you can use to reduce the cost:

                <Text>
                  Gas prices go up and down every twelve seconds based on how
                  congested Ethereum is. When gas prices are high, waiting just
                  a few minutes before making a transaction could see a
                  significant drop in what you pay.{" "}

                  At popular times, congestion can sustain longer. Just like
                  off-peak travel is less crowded and more cost-effective,
                  Ethereum is usually more affordable during off-peak periods,
                  particularly during North American nighttime hours.

                  In November 2017, the popular CryptoKitties project was
                  launched. Its rapid spike in popularity caused significant
                  network congestion and extremely high gas fees. The challenges
                  posed by CryptoKitties accelerated the urgency of finding
                  solutions for scaling Ethereum.

                  Gas is a critical element in keeping Ethereum secure and
                  processing transactions. Gas helps in many ways:

              <Text>
                Whenever the amount of computation (gas) being done on Ethereum
                exceeds its target level, gas fees will begin to increase. The
                more it goes over the target level, the quicker gas fees
                increase.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                Higher fees could be caused by things like popular dapps or
                NFTs, periodically increased trading on DEXs, or an overwhelming
                number of user activity at peak times.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                Developers on Ethereum should take care to optimise their smart
                contracts usage before deploying. If lots of people are using a
                poorly written smart contract, it will consume more gas and
                could inadvertently cause network congestion.

                  computation? More complex actions, like interacting with a

                The formula for calculating a gas fee is units of gas used *
                (base fee + priority fee). Most wallets will calculate gas usage
                and display it in a more straight-forward way.
