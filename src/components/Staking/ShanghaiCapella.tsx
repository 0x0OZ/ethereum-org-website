            Withdrawal functionality will be enabled in the upcoming Shanghai upgrade
            planned for Q1/Q2 2023 (as with any upgrade, timing subject to
            change). This enables previously staked ETH to be deposited into
            execution layer accounts, closing the loop on staking liquidity, and
            taking one more step on Ethereum‚Äôs journey towards building a
            sustainable, scalable, secure decentralized ecosystem.

            For the Shanghai upgrade to take effect, a simultaneous upgrade to
            the Beacon Chain must take place named Capella. Node operating
            stakers should stay tuned to client communication channels to be
            alerted of upcoming client updates planned for Q1 2023.

            Stakers who need to update their validator withdrawal keys can
            broadcast this message once the Capella upgrade has taken place.
